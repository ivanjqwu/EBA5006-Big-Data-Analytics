This story came from the creator of My Dog:\u201cAlthough I have participated in the development of several games, I have not been as excited with a new game as with My Dog because this game brings back a lot of good memories. When I was little, my parents adopted a puppy that lived with us for longer than fifteen years. I still remember our first interaction; he could fit in my palm. As a child, I became his owner and did my best to take care of him. From an early age, I gained this sense of responsibility because of him but also developed a strong feeling of sympathy towards the dog community. I decided not to have another puppy after him because I knew it would be difficult to experience this absence again in the future. At university, I kept thinking of ways to bring my puppy back to me by using technology. However, it was not until recently that I formed a dedicated team of engineers and artists to develop My Dog. I hope that players can raise their favorite puppy while bringing him everywhere with them, creating good memories.If you find this story interesting, want to share your own story, or enjoy playing our game, please send us an email games@boltrend.com. We hope that My Dog help reunites dog owners with his beloved friends and help our puppies find a loving family.
